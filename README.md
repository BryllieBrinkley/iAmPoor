# iAmPoor
poor mans version of the "I Am Rich" App that I created

This commit marks the completion of my "I Am Poor" project. I learned many things throughout this project including how to create and setup a new iOS project from scratch, how to navigate and design my app using Xcode, how to incorporate image assets into my app, how to design and create custom app icons, and how to run my app on a simulator as well as on my iPhone! I am very excited to see what my next projects will be!!
